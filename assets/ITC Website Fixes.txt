ITC Website Fix
High Priority
- Event Information section (Layout/design is confusing)
- Sponsors (not finished)
- Huge space between Q&A and Tournament section
- Games button functionality (goes directly to the tournament section which causes users to scroll back up)
- Games button functionality is not noticeably (need to differentiate it when you hover over it)

Medium Priority
- Contact Us does not exist
- Follow Us does not exist 
- Games/Events/Server menu header too small and unnoticeable

Low Priority 
- Tournament background - improve computer glass effect
- Making scrolling through the page more interesting (ie. fade effects)
- Shrink nav menu
